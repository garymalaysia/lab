Oh no, someone has made a bad security decision.

In this directory there are the files plaintext1.txt, ciphertext1.txt and ciphertext2.txt.

Both ciphertext1.txt and ciphertext2.txt were made from a One Time Pad cryptosystem.  Unfortunately the operator reused the key.  That is, both of these ciphertexts were encrypted using the One Time Pad scheme with the same key.  

What's worse, you have managed to get the plaintext for ciphertext1.txt!  This file is called plaintext1.txt.

Now it is an easy matter to find plaintext2.txt, which is the plaintext for ciphertext2.txt. 

For this problem please submit plaintext2.txt.
